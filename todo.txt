Final missing transport:
    Master:
    (City of Um teleport incantation; not sure if same as tome)
    (((Runespan portal, runespan pads on high floor to east and then north)))
    (and the fishing platform and entrana connections as mentioned above)
    Kag Ship transports
    Wildy volcano stepping stone and cliff climb
    ED Chests
    Dorgesh Khaan: Grapple hooks
                   Stairs up to the agility arena

- Solving Behaviour
    -
    - Path Panel
        - [Feature] Disable default teleport render when contained in step
            - Render step instead
        - [Feature] Cleanup using "fake" steps:
            - Combine surges/dives following a powerburst into one "fake" step
            - Duplicate shortcut step to exist in both sections
            - Combine run followed by shortcut into one
    - Preferences
        - Preferred npc spot
    - Scan Tree Behaviour
        - Make fit include the entire path
        - Better render of in-route teleports
        - Spacing in the tree view is bad

- [5] Settings Modal
    - Method Pack Management

- Issues
    - [Bug, 1] SearchSelection: Very rarely the dropdown remains after the element is already gone
    - [Bug, 3] The highlight-syncing for the path list while solving does not work

- Performance
    - [4] Teleport icons use 4 DOM nodes, while skillbert's map just needs 1
    - [3] Graticule should probably be changed to not use one svg element per line. Either render to canvas or combine lines into one svg.
    - [3] Share a quad tree for all game layers. Cull empty branches.

- Scan Editor
    - [QOL, 2] Include uncertainty from non-static teleports into path analysis
        - Ability after uncertainty => Error
        - Dive needs to be possible for all tiles
    - Improved implicit instructions
    - [3] Autoname areas
    - [3] Autonumber spots
    - Better placement of information marker to guarantee it's always inside the area.
    - Scale information gain down when zoomed out

- Path Editor
    - [Feature] Show number of tiles when drawing a run
    - [Feature, 3] Highlight step on hover
    - Teleports don't use tile areas correctly
    - [Feature] Check if teleport spot is actually in target area
    - [Bug] Scroll bleeding through: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73195855/mouse-scroll-affects-underlying-map-instead-of-leaflewt-custom-control
    - [Feature] Check valid access

- Context Menu Builder
    - Creating context menus currently is a little annoying

- Map Entities
    - [Feature, 2] Find a way to separate entities on the same tile

- Theorycrafter
    - Editor for generic path methods
        - Display Target-Areas and auxiliary stuff (hidey hole) on map
            - Share with Solver!
    - Collapsible method pack sections (default|imported|local)
    - [QOL] Improved Import Modal
        - Paste or drop file
        - Show metadata before import
        - Confirm/Cancel
    - [Feature] Undo/Redo

- General
    - [Styling] ControlHeader title and X are not properly aligned
        - Check modal for how to do it
    - Clean up cursor on map
    - Remove old Modals
        - Patchnotes
    - Add short summary sentence to update notifications
    - Use the new ExpansionBehaviour wherever it's applicable

Content principles:
    - Less is more for written instructions, let rendered path speak for itself
    - Prefer easy to identify target tiles

Ready for release:
- [Presentation] reenable walls on the map.
- [Tooling, Presentation] Subtle Walkable-Overlay.
- [Tooling] Add a permanent tile highlight when moving the mouse over the map
- Lumbridge Caves: A, B and C are at floor 2, not 0. Check whether that checks out ingame
- Fix floor of Dorgesh Khaan spot E
- Update Deep Wildy Scan/Wilderness Crater
- Update compass spots from rsmv
- Have a way to directly link to a given clue and its method with query parameters.
- Shortcut editor
- The internal datastructure for clues has been revamped and now includes more detail about the individual steps.
- OverviewLayer/theorycrafter
    - You can edit methods locally, share them as content packs.

RELEASE 1.0
- Auto read pulses
- [Tech] Overlay pathing into the game.
    - If this works, it is HUGE. Idea: Fix Camera distance and height by zooming out and clicking the compass, then calibrate camera transform using a suitable environment, Falador party room might actually be great.
    - Player position is input explicitly by placing a marker on the map.
    - This should be enough to draw polygons into the world as long as the camera height is not modified.
    - Yaw can be read by the compass on the minimap.
    - Camera orientation/position: Developer console 'getcamerapos'.
      Format:  floor,chunkx,chunkz,subx,subz


Unscheduled (Far future):
- [What] Incorporate jacket/backpack recommmendations
- Add some kind of discord integration with Fairy Nuff (Mike, if you stumble upon this: I have some ideas :) )
- Integrate a solving method for compasses. (This is important because having both solvers open takes up too much screen.)
- Better algorithm to combine equivalence classes.
- Better algorithm to construct polygon for equivalence class (with hole support).
- Warn when not using meerkats
- Track Jacket/Backpack Charges via Chat, display them
- Figure out z-Ordering of layers (need to use custom panes maybe)
