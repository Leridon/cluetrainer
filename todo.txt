Issues
    - [Bug, 1] SearchSelection: Very rarely the dropdown remains after the element is already gone
    - [Bug] Knot reader fails: https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1103737270114209825/1241500553805172898
    - capturehold failed needs to be handled more gracefully, capture interval needs to be respected
    - [Bug, 2] Clue Reader Pausing for knots is bad because it unpauses while the animation is happening.
    - Zoom for long distance transports is still very bad

Path Editor:
    Custom sized square (to help map distances), purely for theorycrafting
    Some sort of parallel world method of displaying steps (with non static teleports), if implemented, preferably differentiatable between absolute and relative step instructions

- Scan Tree Solver
    - Zoom to path is way too far out.
    - Clicking on a spot on the map needs to do something useful


Custom Modal Solution:
    - It's no coincidence that bs is short for both bootstrap and bullshit.
    - Implement a custom solution to show/hide modals, that doesn't have all of the timing bugs bootstrap has







- Solving Behaviour
    - Path Panel
        - [Feature] Disable default teleport render when contained in step
            - Render step instead
        - [Feature] Cleanup using "fake" steps:
            - Combine surges/dives following a powerburst into one "fake" step
            - Duplicate shortcut step to exist in both sections
            - Combine run followed by shortcut into one
    - Preferences
        - Preferred npc spot
    - Scan Tree Behaviour
        - Make fit include the entire path
        - Better render of in-route teleports
        - Spacing in the tree view is bad

- Performance
    - [3] Share a quad tree for all game layers. Cull empty branches.

- Scan Editor
    - [QOL, 2] Include uncertainty from non-static teleports into path analysis
        - Ability after uncertainty => Error
        - Dive needs to be possible for all tiles
    - Improved implicit instructions
    - [3] Autoname areas
    - [3] Autonumber spots
    - Better placement of information marker to guarantee it's always inside the area.
    - Scale information gain down when zoomed out

- Path Editor
    - [Feature, 3] Highlight step on hover
    - Teleports don't use tile areas correctly
    - [Feature] Check if teleport spot is actually in target area
    - [Bug] Scroll bleeding through: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73195855/mouse-scroll-affects-underlying-map-instead-of-leaflewt-custom-control
    - [Feature] Check valid access

- Context Menu Builder
    - Creating context menus currently is a little annoying

- Map Entities
    - [Feature, 2] Find a way to separate entities on the same tile

- Theorycrafter
    - Editor for generic path methods
        - Display Target-Areas and auxiliary stuff (hidey hole) on map
            - Share with Solver!
    - Collapsible method pack sections (default|imported|local)
    - [QOL] Improved Import Modal
        - Paste or drop file
        - Show metadata before import
        - Confirm/Cancel
    - [Feature] Undo/Redo

- General
    - [Styling] ControlHeader title and X are not properly aligned
        - Check modal for how to do it
    - Clean up cursor on map
    - Remove old Modals
        - Patchnotes
    - Add short summary sentence to update notifications
    - Use the new ExpansionBehaviour wherever it's applicable

Content principles:
    - Less is more for written instructions, let rendered path speak for itself
    - Prefer easy to identify target tiles

Ready for release:
- [Presentation] reenable walls on the map.
- [Tooling, Presentation] Subtle Walkable-Overlay.
- [Tooling] Add a permanent tile highlight when moving the mouse over the map
- Lumbridge Caves: A, B and C are at floor 2, not 0. Check whether that checks out ingame
- Fix floor of Dorgesh Khaan spot E
- Update Deep Wildy Scan/Wilderness Crater
- Update compass spots from rsmv
- Have a way to directly link to a given clue and its method with query parameters.
- Shortcut editor
- The internal datastructure for clues has been revamped and now includes more detail about the individual steps.
- OverviewLayer/theorycrafter
    - You can edit methods locally, share them as content packs.

RELEASE 1.0
- Auto read pulses
- [Tech] Overlay pathing into the game.
    - If this works, it is HUGE. Idea: Fix Camera distance and height by zooming out and clicking the compass, then calibrate camera transform using a suitable environment, Falador party room might actually be great.
    - Player position is input explicitly by placing a marker on the map.
    - This should be enough to draw polygons into the world as long as the camera height is not modified.
    - Yaw can be read by the compass on the minimap.
    - Camera orientation/position: Developer console 'getcamerapos'.
      Format:  floor,chunkx,chunkz,subx,subz


Unscheduled (Post launch, if ever):
- Track Jacket/Backpack Charges via Chat, display them as a permanent overlay
- Totem reminder
- Verified speedrunning
- [What] Incorporate jacket/backpack recommmendations
- Add some kind of discord integration with Fairy Nuff (Mike, if you stumble upon this: I have some ideas :) )
- Better algorithm to combine equivalence classes.
- Better algorithm to construct polygon for equivalence class (with hole support).
- Warn when not using meerkats
