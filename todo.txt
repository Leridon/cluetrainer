Backlog:
    - Scan panel configurability
    - Fix tooltips for spots in scan trees.
    - Highlighting first step of slider would be helpful
    - Teleport access needs to be rendered in some way, if applicable
    - Tooltip for teleports in paths is bad, use the one for standalone teleports
    - Floors of scan areas aren't visualized.
    - Clean up implicit scan step instructions
    - Direct links to cluepedia
    - Default to last relevant section when setting a path (Configurable)
    - [BUG] Possible Race condition when commiting/discarding angles causing wrong zoom
    - Add cooldown reset when dive intends to kill a target
    - [Bug] Tick accuracy for redclicks
    - Add explanations for runekit (https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1103737270114209825/1358164011056759064)


- Compasses (v36?):
    - Commiting an angle sometimes has a noticeable delay
        - ~~Probably just lag because it's checking nearly 500 spots. Optimize with quad tree.~~
        - Bottleneck is most likely map rendering
    - Sometimes, the compass calibration is slightly off (https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1103737270114209825/1318205858601107497)
        - This is due to antialiasing => Increase epsilon for AA
        - Add interactive indicator to overlay
    - Being fast with b2b compasses and a skipped wizard between doesn't reset properly.
        - Some grayish backgrounds facilitate this because it thinks it's still open in the solved state. Needs finetuning
    - When the first beam narrows the spots down to only a few and you take a gamble going straight to one of them, it will commit an angle to the second teleport of the preset and delete the correct solution
    - Add compass explanations to cluepedia

- Configurable hotkeys (v37?):
    - Global settings
    - Profile settings


- Globetrotter Charge Tracking (v??)


- Totem Reminder (v??)


- Large Method Renaming, Add non-meta methods (v??)


- Tick Accuracy (v??)
    - Run + Redclick does not account for the tick you have to wait after arriving
    - Powerburst of Acceleration does not reset everything correctly (consult pup)

Issues
    - [Bug, 1] SearchSelection: Very rarely the dropdown remains after the element is already gone
    - [Bug] Knot reader fails: https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1103737270114209825/1241500553805172898
    - [Bug, 2] Clue Reader Pausing for knots is bad because it unpauses while the animation is happening.
    - [Bug, 4] Selecting another method while a scan tree method is active glitches
    - [Bug] Master Compasses reset sometimes to the elite compass (https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1103737270114209825/1287161070645149818)
    - [Bug] Text inputs with the legacy skin are rarely detected as puzzles
    - Some slider puzzles are still detected in the desert after the puzzle closed (https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1103737270114209825/1315159104792166490)
    - For some people, lockboxes desync like crazy (alan mostly)
    - Invalid LatLng object in various cases

Path Editor:
    - Better tooling for routing runs (https://discord.com/channels/@me/1216512712255864853/1352379562826272838)
    - Custom sized square (to help map distances), purely for theorycrafting
    - Some sort of parallel world method of displaying steps (with non static teleports), if implemented, preferably differentiatable between absolute and relative step instructions

- Solving Behaviour
    - Path Panel
        - [Feature] Disable default teleport render when contained in step
            - Render step instead
        - [Feature] Cleanup using "fake" steps:
            - Combine surges/dives following a powerburst into one "fake" step
            - Combine run followed by shortcut into one
    - Preferences
        - Preferred npc spot
    - Scan Tree Behaviour
        - Spacing in the tree view is bad

- Map Performance
    - [3] Share a quad tree for all game layers. Cull empty branches.
    - [3] <img>-elements should probably be preserved in-memory for markers when hidden
    - [3] Using :hover style rules would probably be faster than the current way of rerendering. Would also reduce some of the pain with lingering activations

- Scan Editor
    - [QOL, 2] Include uncertainty from non-static teleports into path analysis
        - Ability after uncertainty => Error
        - Dive needs to be possible for all tiles
    - Improved implicit instructions
    - [3] Autoname areas
    - [3] Autonumber spots
    - Better placement of information marker to guarantee it's always inside the area.
    - Scale information gain down when zoomed out

Compass solver:
    - [Postponed] Chatbox read service to look for sextant message

- Path Editor
    - [Feature, 3] Highlight step on hover
    - Teleports don't use tile areas correctly
    - [Feature] Check if teleport spot is actually in target area
    - [Bug] Scroll bleeding through: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73195855/mouse-scroll-affects-underlying-map-instead-of-leaflewt-custom-control
    - [Feature] Check valid access

- Context Menu Builder
    - Creating context menus currently is a little annoying

- Theorycrafter
    - Editor for generic path methods
        - Display Target-Areas and auxiliary stuff (hidey hole) on map
            - Share with Solver!
    - [QOL] Improved Import Modal
        - Show metadata before import
        - Confirm/Cancel
    - [Feature] Undo/Redo

- General
    - [Styling] ControlHeader title and X are not properly aligned
        - Check modal for how to do it

Uncategorized:
- Verified speedrunning
- Better algorithm to combine equivalence classes.
- Improve information gain for equivalence classes by judging the value of that particular information. (https://discord.com/channels/@me/1216512712255864853/1350781923940765727)
- Better algorithm to construct polygon for equivalence class (with hole support).
