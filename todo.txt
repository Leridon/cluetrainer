Patch Notes for next release:
** Compass Solver **
    - The UI for the compass solver has been redesigned.
    - There is a new option to have the compass solver use your predicted your current position based on the solution of the previous clue as the first triangulation option.
        - For scans, this is the rectangle containing all dig spots that are possible with the progress you entered for the scan tree.
        - You can also click a dig spot for scans to manually set it as the solution.
    - The compass reader has been recalibrated to be even more accurate than before.
    - The compass reader can now detect the use of MSAA and adjusts its calibration appropriately.
    - The compass solver now supports showing paths from method packs.
        - The shown path defaults to the spot closest to all the triangulation lines. Click a marker to change the selection.

**Additionally**
    - Optimized rendering of gridlines and teleports on the map for significant performance improvements.
        - Optimization is an ongoing process, so let me know how performance is for you now and if you notice a difference.
    - Removed ability icons for rendered paths since they clutter the map and the colors of the arrows should be obvious enough.
    - Added optional note-areas to dives and running-steps in the path editor. Using these to simplify existing paths is WIP
    - Rendering for dives now uses distinct arrow shapes for far-clickable and precise dives.
        - This relies on a change in the dataformat, so you need to migrate any existing paths you have. You can find this option by right-clicking the method pack in the Methods tab.
    - Errors and warnings in the path editor are now shown in a minimized format to save space. Hove over them to see the details.
    - Fixed the "Export" function for method packs that's apparently been broken for ages. (The base64-version, not the JSON version)
    - Entity-Tooltips now behave much smoother when the entity is right-clicked
    - When drawing a run step in the path editor, the number of tiles this covers is now shown as part of the preview.
    - Teleport customization now starts out as empty instead of the Clue Chasers recommendations.



Compass solver:
    - [Bug] Selecting a spot while all spots are possible causes all methods to be previewed
    - MSAA Calibration
    - Predicted start spot from last scan position
    - Explanation Modal
    - Fix fight for zoom-authority between compass and path.
    - Add markers for triangulation spots?
    - Chatbox read service to look for sextant message
    - compass reader is leaning too much towards concealed instead of closed, which messes up b2b compasses (with a wizard inbetween)

Issues
    - [Bug, 1] SearchSelection: Very rarely the dropdown remains after the element is already gone
    - [Bug] Knot reader fails: https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1103737270114209825/1241500553805172898
    - capturehold failed needs to be handled more gracefully, capture interval needs to be respected
    - [Bug, 2] Clue Reader Pausing for knots is bad because it unpauses while the animation is happening.
    - Zoom for long distance transports is still very bad

Path Display:
    - Path normalization for method packs migrations
        - Add is_far_dive property to dives
    Custom sized square (to help map distances), purely for theorycrafting
    Some sort of parallel world method of displaying steps (with non static teleports), if implemented, preferably differentiatable between absolute and relative step instructions

- Scan Tree Solver
    - Zoom to path is way too far out.
    - Clicking on a spot on the map needs to do something useful


Custom Modal Solution:
    - It's no coincidence that bs is short for both bootstrap and bullshit.
    - Implement a custom solution to show/hide modals, that doesn't have all of the timing bugs bootstrap has

Final missing transport:
    Master:
    (City of Um teleport incantation; not sure if same as tome)
    (((Runespan portal, runespan pads on high floor to east and then north)))
    (and the fishing platform and entrana connections as mentioned above)
    Kag Ship transports
    Wildy volcano stepping stone and cliff climb
    ED Chests
    Dorgesh Khaan: Grapple hooks
                   Stairs up to the agility arena
                   Stairs down to both the north east and south west buildings
   Daemonheim guard to wildy (also ED2 guard)
    Fort Forinthry gate to that
    Taverley dungeon ladder to Water obby
    Boss portal to barrows
    (add boss portal transport to reaper portal)
    Stepping stones in the east and maybe also the shilo gate (for comparison)
    Soul wars portal
    Shantay Pass
    Al kharid mine rock climb
    Death Plateau rock wall climb

RELEASE 1.0
- Auto read pulses
- [Tech] Overlay pathing into the game.
    - If this works, it is HUGE. Idea: Fix Camera distance and height by zooming out and clicking the compass, then calibrate camera transform using a suitable environment, Falador party room might actually be great.
    - Player position is input explicitly by placing a marker on the map.
    - This should be enough to draw polygons into the world as long as the camera height is not modified.
    - Yaw can be read by the compass on the minimap.
    - Camera orientation/position: Developer console 'getcamerapos'.
      Format:  floor,chunkx,chunkz,subx,subz


Unscheduled (Post launch, if ever):
- Track Jacket/Backpack Charges via Chat, display them as a permanent overlay
- Totem reminder
- Verified speedrunning
- [What] Incorporate jacket/backpack recommmendations
- Add some kind of discord integration with Fairy Nuff (Mike, if you stumble upon this: I have some ideas :) )
- Better algorithm to combine equivalence classes.
- Better algorithm to construct polygon for equivalence class (with hole support).
- Warn when not using meerkats
